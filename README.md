# NBA-Data: Intro <img align="right" src="https://static-s.aa-cdn.net/img/amazon/30600000151889/05c429ffa0a860ed80ca04c1a6724faf?v=1" style="width: 20%; height: auto;max-width: 120px;max-height: 100px">
A series of projects using NBA stats scraped from basketballreference.com. Find here the methods used to scrape basketball season and player statistics, as well as the csv files containing said data. I often use this data for experimental, exploratory, and educational projects, as it is a dataset I am familiar with, within a context that I understand well. It can have some problems applying deep learning and regression methods sometimes, as the data can be somewhat sparse along some features, and drifts due to contexts like rule changes, increasing popularity, team expansions, etc. 70 years of professional basketball is a lot of data for a human, but for data-hungry ML models it can often be woefully inadequate

## NBA-KMeans:  <img align="right" src="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2019/every-shot-dirk-ever-took/images/_dirk-hero.png" style="width: 15%; height: auto;max-width: 120px;max-height: 100px">
This is an EDA-style project focused primarily around K-Means clustering algorithm. Media surrounding the NBA has recently introduced the idea of "unicorns": players with skillsets commonly associated with shorter "guard" position players, who nonetheless tower at the gargantuan heights of the tallest NBA giants. I set out to attempt to cluster NBA players by their contributions by using the K-Means algorithm on profiles of their box score statistics, in order to identify some more of these unicorns from a statistical point of view.
